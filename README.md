## Use of Vercel v0 (AI UI Generation)

During the development of **Araku Coffee**, **Vercel v0** was used for **UI generation and layout ideation**.  
The following sections were prototyped with Vercel v0 and later refined manually for better responsiveness, color consistency, and code clarity:

- **Hero Section:** Split layout (text + image) and CTA structure  
- **Features Section:** 3-card grid layout with balanced spacing  
- **Product Highlights Section:** uniform info cards with icon integration  
- **Contact Section:** clean input form hierarchy and spacing  
- **Footer Section:** navigation grouping and brand details layout  

After generation, manual improvements were made to:
- Ensure consistent **black & brown coffee brand theme**  
- Optimize **accessibility and responsive behavior**  
- Maintain clean and production-ready **React JSX code**

> This fulfills the assignment requirement:  
> **"Vercel v0 (compulsory usage for UI generation)"**
